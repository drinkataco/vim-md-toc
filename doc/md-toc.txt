INTRODUCTION                                                    *md-toc-intro*

This plugin allows you to generate a table of contents for your markdown
files, based off of the headers. With configuration, you can set max children
leveling, style (numbered or bullet), and ignore patterns. The table of
contents can be set to auto update on file save with the |g:mdtoc_autoupdate|
config
